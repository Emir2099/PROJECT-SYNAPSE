# Release Notes

User-facing changelog for Project Synapse.

## Version 2.2.0 - November 1, 2025

### 🚀 What's New

**Automatic Updates**
Never manually download updates again! Project Synapse now checks for updates automatically and downloads them in the background. When a new version is ready, you'll get a notification to install with just one click.

**Smart Delta Updates**
Updates are incredibly efficient now. Instead of downloading the entire 150MB installer, the app only downloads the changes (typically 5-20MB), saving bandwidth and time.

**Beautiful In-App Changelog**
See what's new with our gorgeous changelog viewer. Click the "Updates" button in the sidebar to view release notes with clean formatting and easy navigation between versions.

**Update Notifications**
Stay informed with elegant notifications that show download progress and let you install updates at your convenience.

### 🎯 Technical Improvements

- Auto-update system powered by electron-updater
- Delta differential updates for faster downloads
- GitHub Releases integration for reliable update delivery
- Real-time download progress tracking
- Seamless install-and-restart workflow

### 💡 How It Works

The app checks for updates when you launch it and periodically while running. When an update is available, you'll see a "NEW" badge on the Updates button. Click it to view what's new, then download and install with one click. The next time you use the app, you'll be on the latest version!
